nBack is a game to improve one's short term memory!

@author: Marc Coury and Jonathan King

To run from terminal, type 

python main.py

This currently works with python version 2.7.5.

To run on an Android phone or tablet follow these steps:
  1.  Download the app: "Kivy Launcher".
  2.  Make sure that there is a file called "kivy" on your phone or tablet.
  3.  Put the source code folder into the kivy file on your phone or tablet.
  4.  Open the kivy app from your phone or tablet and nBack should appear as
      an option. Just press it to open the game.

This should also work on iOS, but I have not tested it yet.
